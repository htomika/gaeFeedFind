Test project for parsing html (Python)
==================================

This is a test project for experimenting with python html parsing on Google App Engine.

Uses:
-------------------------------

1) Google App Engine

2) BeautifulSoap

3) AngularJS

4) Google Cloud Endpoints (REST) - (suspended, fallback to ajax)

5) Pusher (suspended, gae socket limited)

6) App Engine Task Queues, defer library


Step-by-step guide for using the parser:
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Locate the index page (/)

2) Log in with Google Accounts (saves the query with the account name, so previous queries can be reviewed)

3) Type in the URL

4) Wait a sec and click Reload
  - (Wait for results, or submit another one (the deferred process sends an update message on the Pusher channel to the client to update the table))

5) Come back and review results


ToDo:
------------------------------------------------------------

- REST backend replacement (https://code.google.com/p/appengine-rest-server)
- Auth for REST backend (instead of the present users.get_current_user())
- Private channel w/ auth for Pusher
- Non-Standard feed link recognition
